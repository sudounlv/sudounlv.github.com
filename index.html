<p>How does this whole thing work?</p>

<ul>
<li>Problems will be provided every other Monday evening at 8PM PST or slightly thereafter. Generally will be in the form of a word problem, perhaps with explanatory diagrams. However, we reserve the right to change the format to be slightly more interesting.</li>
<li>Submission of your solutions should be mailed to <code>codechallenge@sudounlv.com</code>. Please include <code>SUBMISSION</code> in the subject line to make it easy on us.</li>
<li>Submission closes 48 hours after the problem is posted.</li>
<li>Resubmissions are allowed. However, the last solution one submits over the timeframe will be the one graded. If you submit an incorrect program over a correct program, or a correct program over another correct program 12 hours later, tough luck!</li>
<li>An incorrect solution is an incorrect solution. No partial credit!</li>
<li>However, we're a bit flexible about the output format, with potentially limited exceptions. You won't be disqualified if the problem states that you output "Case 0: 2" and you forget the colon, etc.</li>
<li>Until the end of the week's competition, no assertions will be provided to us as to the correctness of a program.</li>
<li>The instructions for correct submissions will be provided with the problem, but will generally follow this pattern:<br><ul>
<li>There will be some input/output pair[s] provided with the problem that validate <em>some</em> level of correctness of your program.</li>
<li>There will be an input provided without its corresponding output.</li>
<li>A complete submission will involve the corresponding output for the secret input, as well as the source code. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>But wait, can I ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Use whatever language I want?

<ul>
<li>Yes! You definitely don't have to stick to C or C++. If the language you're using isn't among those included by default on *NIX machines (Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, C++, C, Shell, etc.), it must have a freely-available compiler/runtime and we'd really appreciate instructions on how to run it.</li>
<li>Please, no submissions in <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list">any of these languages though</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use third party libraries?

<ul>
<li>Use of third party libraries is limited to tedium only. If the problem asks you to solve a problem like finding the minimum distance path from point X to Y over a graph, libraries that do basic string manipulation or list sorting are fine, but a 'find the min-path over this graph' library would not be OK. </li>
<li>It would be wise to stick to the standard libraries. Any non-standard libraries used should be attached to your submission in whatever format makes sense for your language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work with others?

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, there is a hard balance to level between comradrie and competition. We encourage you to meet up and work on these problems, and encourage discussion and debates about the best way to solve the problem.</li>
<li>However, source code sharing is <strong>strictly verboten</strong>. If this happens, all involved parties' scores for the week will be 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions about the problem?

<ul>
<li>Absolutely! We encourage questions that ask about clarifications to the problem, about the competition in general, or ask about our favorite color. Unfortunately, we cannot answer questions about how best to solve the problems, whether an approach you are considering is correct, etc.</li>
<li>We'll do our best to make available answers via email (<code>codechallenge@sudounlv.com</code>) or in our IRC channel: <code>#sudounlv</code> on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
</li>
<li>Frequently asked questions will be posted on the code challenge page as soon as is reasonable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Points!</p>

<ul>
<li>Points are accumulated across the entire semester</li>
<li>Points are awarded based on the order of the correct submissions, whether it takes 30 minutes, an hour, or a day!

<ul>
<li>First place: 100</li>
<li>Second place: 80</li>
<li>Third place: 60</li>
<li>All others: 40</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the 48 hour submission period is over, our reference solution will be posted, along with the point winners for that problem.</li>
<li>At the end of the semester, we will add up the points and declare the winners!</li>
</ul>
</li>
